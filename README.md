# MUSA 611 Final Project

## Overview
Hi there! This repository is for a final project for MUSA 611 at UPenn in collaboration with the MUSA practicum. The MUSA 611 project will be completed by Kristin Chang and Jenna Epstein.

## Project Proposal

The goal of this project is to develop a web application for our client in the MUSA practicum, the Capital Improvement Department's Planning Division in the City of El Paso, Texas. The client is interested in improving their system for deciding where and how to allocate capital improvement funds for road repairs. Presently, this is determined using a Pavement Condition Index (PCI). In 2018, a private contractor assigned each road segment under the city's jurisidiction a PCI score based on a digital image scan. With this knowledge, we can infer that PCI scores are heavily dependent on physical conditions of the road such as potholes, cracks, or bumps. Whenever the city receives a request for a repair, they confirm that the PCI score for that road segment is low, and fulfill the request. <br>

The current decision-making process is reactive and can be made more proactive by incorporating other factors to consider such as the population that the roads are servicing, the level of traffic congestion, or how a road repair may contribute to a Vision Zero or other Safe Streets city plan. The web application will do just this by allowing users to adjust weights for various decision factors and generate a priority list of road segments based on the weights. <br>

The new tool will be made to mirror the user interface of existing mapping tools in the department in order to minimize navigation confusion. The contents of the page include the following:<br>
- Sidebar with background information and instructions to navigate the page
- A bar at the top to house the decision factor weights
- A map in the middle of the page that reacts to the weights
- A sidebar on the right that includes a list of road segments to prioritize based on weights
- Drop down lists for each road segment to display details/the conditions of that particular road
- A login option for city employees to access the raw data<br>

A wireframe for the web application can be found in the images folder of this repository.
